# TODO

+ [X] Make background image loading async, in case the user decides to
      load a massive image or an image from a network location, so as
      not to block the UI
+ [ ] Improve sorting efficiency for item sections
+ [X] Add image brush masks
+ [ ] Improve editor snapshot speed; there should never be any
      lag. Seems to only be an issue on windows
+ [X] Fix scroll-to methods for the timeline panel; they are
      disorienting right now
+ [ ] Implement moats and stairs
